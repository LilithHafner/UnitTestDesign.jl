The Github site has an [Issues page](https://github.com/adolgert/UnitTestDesign.jl/issues),
and my email is listed.

## Branch process

The trunk is called `main`. I use PRs from branches or other repos to main.
If this project needs more than that, let's discuss it.

## Conduct

Let's follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](@ref).
